# Lorentz-contraction

code for 16-bit fixed-point arithmetic in Forth-83.

1. **Constants and Conversion**: Constants should reflect the fixed-point representation. The speed of light constant needs to be in a fixed-point representation that fits within a 16-bit integer while maintaining the necessary precision.

2. **Fixed-Point Multiplication and Division**: The operations on fixed-point numbers should account for the fixed-point format. For multiplication, you typically need to divide by the scale factor (here `FIXED-POINT`) to maintain the correct scale. For division, you multiply by the scale factor.

3. **Square Root**: Calculating the square root in fixed-point arithmetic is not straightforward and usually requires an iterative approach or a lookup table. However, for simplicity, we might use an approximation or a simplification.

4. **Handling Large Numbers**: The program must ensure that multiplication and other operations do not exceed the 16-bit limit. If they do, it must handle overflow appropriately, potentially using the carry flag for large numbers.

code:

### lc-1.f

This version of the program takes the user's input, converts it to fixed-point representation, calculates the Lorentz contraction using an approximation of the Lorentz factor, and then outputs the result in meters. The `LORENTZ-FACTOR` word would need to be filled in with an actual fixed-point square root operation or approximation suitable for your application.

Remember that fixed-point arithmetic is limited in precision and range. If you need higher precision or must handle larger numbers, you might have to use a more complex number representation or switch to a Forth environment that supports floating-point arithmetic or larger integers.

## mathematical components adapted for fixed-point arithmetic 

The classical Lorentz contraction formula is:

\[ L' = L \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^2} \]

where:

- \( L' \) is the length as measured by an observer moving at velocity \( v \) relative to the object.
- \( L \) is the proper length of the object (the length of the object in the frame of reference in which the object is at rest).
- \( v \) is the relative velocity between the observer and the moving object.
- \( c \) is the speed of light.

The original formula includes a square root and a division, operations that can be challenging with fixed-point arithmetic due to their non-linear nature and potential for generating results that don't fit in a fixed number of bits. Here's how the program approximates the formula in Forth:

1. **Fixed-Point Representation**: We use a scaling factor to represent real numbers as integers. Here, we've chosen \( 2^{14} \) as the scaling factor, so 1.0 is represented as \( 16384 \) in our fixed-point system. This allows us to represent fractions in the range \( [0, 1) \).

2. **Constants**: The speed of light is approximated to fit within a 16-bit integer after accounting for the fixed-point scaling. Instead of \( 299792458 \), we use \( 29979 \) with the scaling factor already considered.

3. **Velocity Squared**: We calculate \( v^2 \) as follows:

\[ v'^2 = (v \cdot FIXED\_POINT)^2 = (v \cdot 16384)^2 \]

However, since we're using fixed-point representation, we then need to scale the result back down:

\[ \frac{v'^2}{FIXED\_POINT} = \frac{(v \cdot 16384)^2}{16384} \]

This effectively gives us \( v^2 \) in our fixed-point system.

4. **Beta Factor**: This is \( \left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^2 \), which in fixed-point is represented as:

\[ \text{beta'} = \frac{v'^2}{(c \cdot FIXED\_POINT)^2} \]

Again, after calculating \( v'^2 \), we divide by \( c'^2 \) (where \( c' \) is the speed of light in fixed-point) to get beta in fixed-point.

5. **Lorentz Factor**: In full precision, it would be \( \sqrt{1 - \beta} \). We approximate this by avoiding the square root (since we don't have a simple fixed-point square root function) and instead calculate:

\[ \gamma' = FIXED\_POINT - \text{beta'} \]

This is not the exact Lorentz factor but an approximation. The square root of values close to 1 can be approximated by \( 1 - \frac{1}{2}(1 - x) \) for small \( x \), which is somewhat similar to what's done here, but without the \( \frac{1}{2} \) scaling.

6. **Lorentz Contraction**: The final length \( L' \) is calculated in fixed-point arithmetic:

\[ L' = L \cdot \gamma' \]

Here \( L \) is multiplied by the approximate Lorentz factor \( \gamma' \), and since both are in fixed-point, the result is also in fixed-point and needs to be scaled down by dividing by the FIXED\_POINT constant.

7. **Output**: The result \( L' \) is then converted from fixed-point back to a normal integer representing meters by dividing by the FIXED\_POINT constant.

The program needs to ensure that all calculations are performed within the limits of 16-bit arithmetic, which might require additional handling for potential overflows, especially when squaring the velocity. The carry flag mentioned in the initial user input might be used for this purpose, depending on how the underlying system implements multiplication and other arithmetic operations.
