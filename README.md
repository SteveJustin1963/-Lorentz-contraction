Here is a simple MINT program for calculating the Lorentz contraction:

Given the Lorentz contraction formula:

\[
L = L_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\]

where:
- \(L\) is the contracted length,
- \(L_0\) is the original length (rest length),
- \(v\) is the relative velocity of the moving object,
- \(c\) is the speed of light.

Here's how you could structure a simple example in MINT:

```mint
VAR L0, v, c, L

L0 = 10        // Example original length
v = 200000000  // Example velocity in m/s
c = 299792458  // Speed of light in m/s

L = L0 * SQRT(1 - (v * v) / (c * c))   // Calculate contracted length
PRINT L                                 // Output the contracted length
```

In this example:
- Set `L0` to the rest length of the object.
- Assign a value to `v` to represent the relative velocity.
- `c` is the speed of light, which is a constant.
  
This will calculate the contracted length `L` based on the Lorentz contraction formula. Adjust the values of `L0` and `v` as needed for other scenarios.
