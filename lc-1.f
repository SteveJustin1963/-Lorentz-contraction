( Constants )
16384 CONSTANT FIXED-POINT  \ 1.0 in fixed-point format (2^14 to fit in 16 bits)
29979 CONSTANT SPEED-OF-LIGHT  \ Speed of light in fixed-point (approx. 29979245/1000 to fit in 16 bits)

( Variables )
VARIABLE L  \ Original length in fixed-point representation
VARIABLE V  \ Velocity in fixed-point representation
VARIABLE CONTRACTED-LENGTH  \ Lorentz-contracted length in fixed-point representation

( Conversion between fixed-point and user representation )
: TO-FIXED ( n -- n') FIXED-POINT * ;
: FROM-FIXED ( n' -- n) FIXED-POINT / ;

( Fixed-point operations )
: FP* ( n1' n2' -- n' ) M* FIXED-POINT / ;  \ Fixed-point multiplication
: FP/ ( n1' n2' -- n' ) FIXED-POINT * / ;    \ Fixed-point division

( Lorentz factor calculation )
: LORENTZ-FACTOR ( v -- gamma' )
  DUP FIXED-POINT FP*                    \ v^2/c^2 in fixed-point
  SPEED-OF-LIGHT FIXED-POINT FP* /       \ Divide by c^2 in fixed-point
  FIXED-POINT SWAP -                     \ 1 - v^2/c^2
  \ Here you would insert a fixed-point sqrt operation, but we'll assume a simple approximation
